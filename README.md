An old transformer based typescript framework. Has a unique networking design schema to allow for you to write serialized data to a buffer stream, this version was pre-buffer support on ROBLOX.
This framework utilizes Typescript Transformers in order to register implementations and create reflection meta based on them. This primarily is undocumented, and it was taken directly from a personal project.

This framework also has state management, allowing you to use reflex based states and create react based elements. These states use producers to replicate data between servers and clients. You can create your own JSX fragments within the interface folder, allowing for react/roact based design schemas.
